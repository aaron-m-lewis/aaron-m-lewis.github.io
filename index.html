            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 12px;">Welcome to my website! I'm Aaron Lewis, a junior at the University of Notre
                Dame majoring in computer
                science and minoring in engineering corporate practice. I'm a very motivated individual who loves
                learning new things and how they're relevant in my own life. With my degree, I hope to do
                work that
                makes a tangible difference in the world around me. If you'd like to reach out, please feel free to
                contact me! Scroll down to see some of the work I've done, or keep reading to learn a little more about
                me.</p>
            <p> I'm currently working as a seasonal worker for Village of Glen Ellyn Public Works, and have been since
                the summer of 2022. In my free time I like to workout, listen to new indie music, and play competitive
                video games like Rocket League. On campus, I'm mostly found studying, talking to friends around Dillon Hall,
                playing Spikeball out on South Quad, running to my next intramural sports match, or
                attending one of the many dorm masses.</p>

                <h3>RISC-V Doubly Linked List</h3>
                <a href="https://github.com/gmax9803/riscv-dllist" target="_blank" class="button">View on GitHub</a>
                <p style="margin-bottom: 12px;">My partners and I coded a doubly linked list using RISC-V assembly. Mainly, this project taught us about the intricacies of working with limited amounts of registers, the call stack and how it impacts our code, as well as the organization required to perform doubly linked list operations.</p>

                <h3>Regular Expression Parser</h3>
                <a href="https://github.com/your-username/regex-parser" target="_blank" class="button">View on GitHub</a>
                <p style="margin-bottom: 12px;">Throughout the course of a semester, my partner and I built up our own regular expression parser from scratch in Python. As we learned about better models of computation, starting at deterministic finite automata and ending at Turing machines, we were able to add more features.</p>

                <h3>Constellation Model</h3>
                <p style="margin-bottom: 12px;">During my summer study abroad in London, we were tasked with creating a machine learning project. By utilizing TensorFlow in Python, my team was able to train a convolutional neural network that would process images of the night sky and attempt to identify certain constellations. Due to time constraints and resources, we were not able to make it as accurate as possible, reaching a 65% accuracy in a couple days of training. If I were to redo this project with similar time constraints, I would try to find a dataset with smaller images and work with a smaller model to reduce the number of weights and biases, all to decrease training time and allow for more fine-tuning.</p>

                <h3>Drug Seizures Analysis</h3>
                <a href="https://aaron-m-lewis.github.io/borderProject/" target="_blank" class="button">View Website</a>
                <p>To end my second semester of freshman year, we were tasked with doing a data analysis project in Python. My partner and I decided to use available data on drug seizures at the borders of the United States, looking at metrics throughout time ranging from volume confiscated to number of aggressive encounters. Once we had processed the CSV and JSON files, we utilized the Plotly library in Python to make interesting visualizations of the data, integrating the graphs into a basic webpage.</p>
